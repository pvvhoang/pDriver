This repository includes the scripts and data of the proposed method.

The scripts are in the Script folder and include:</br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;(1) PersonalisedDriverFunctions.R - Developed functions used for our method</br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Prognosis.R - Developed functions used for our prognosis analysis</br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;(3) PersonalisedDriver-v10.Rmd - Main script for the method</br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;(4) PersonalisedDriver-v10.html - Main script for the method in html
    
The data are in the Data folder and include:</br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Input files</br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Output files in Output folder

Notes:</br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;(1) You might need to unzip hsa.zip file (TransmiR dataset for TF-miRNA interactions) before using it.</br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;(2) As the file BRCA_matchedData_full.RData (Tumour expression data) is larger than 100 MB, we are not allowed to upload it here, you might need to download it from https://github.com/pvvhoang/CancerDriver/releases/tag/v2.0
