This repository includes the scripts and data of the proposed method.

The scripts are in the Script folder and include:
    (1) PersonalisedDriverFunctions.R - Developed functions used for our method
    (2) Prognosis.R - Developed functions used for our prognosis analysis
    (3) PersonalisedDriver-v10.Rmd - Main script for the method
    (4) PersonalisedDriver-v10.html - Main script for the method in html
    
The data are in the Data folder and include:
    (1) Input files
    (2) Output files in Output folder

Notes:
    (1) You might need to unzip hsa.zip file (TransmiR dataset for TF-miRNA interactions) before using it.
    (2) As the file BRCA_matchedData_full.RData (Tumour expression data) is larger than 100 MB, we are not allowed to upload it here, you might need to download it from https://github.com/pvvhoang/CancerDriver/releases/tag/v2.0
