This repository includes the scripts and data of the proposed method.

The scripts are in the Script folder and include:</br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) PersonalisedDriverFunctions.R - Developed functions used for our method</br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) PersonalisedDriver-v20.Rmd - Main script for the method</br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) PersonalisedDriver-v20.html - Main script for the method in html
    
The data are in the Data folder and include:</br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Input files</br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Output files for BRCA (in Output folder), LUAD (in LUAD folder), LUSC (in LUSC folder), KIRC (in KIRC folder), and HNSC (in HNSC folder)

Notes:</br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) You might need to unzip hsa.zip file (TransmiR dataset for TF-miRNA interactions) before using it.</br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) As the data files are large, we do not upload them here, you might need to download them from https://github.com/pvvhoang/pDriver/releases/tag/v1.0
